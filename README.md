# ACM-NetworkingTalk
This repo holds the chatroom scripts, various C/Python networking programs and presentation for my 2017 ACM networking talk I gave at OU

## How to use the scripts
- Start the server: python3 server.py or ./server.py
- connect a client: python3 client.py {host} or ./client.py {host}
  - {host} is your servers ip address 
  - if you want to communicate on the same computer you can just use 127.0.0.1 which is the localhost address
